        |  Michail and I have actually known each other for a long time! We met in 6th grade when Michail transferred into the Mequon-Thiensville school district. By 7th grade, I‚Äôm pretty sure he had a massive crush on me, so it was unsurprising when in 8th grade, he asked me on a date to ‚Äúeat Oreos and see the new Evan Almighty movie‚Äù with him.

        span.about__person.about__person--michail Michail
        |  Unfortunately for me, Sarah shot me down! Really, though, how could anyone refuse an offer like that? Realizing I came on a bit strong, I eased up for a couple years. Sarah and I didn‚Äôt become close again until the summer before our sophomore year of high school.

        span.about__person.about__person--sarah Sarah
        |  Michail certainly grew up quite a bit between 8th grade and sophomore year, and I couldn‚Äôt help but notice he was becoming quite the young man - funny, clever, and full of boundless energy. However, some things about a person just don‚Äôt change. One day after school, I wasn‚Äôt particularly surprised when Michail told me he‚Äôd lost his house keys, and his parents wouldn‚Äôt be home several hours.

        | We were already super adorable at that point, so we watched the Lion King and ate a frozen pizza while holding hands on Sarah‚Äôs couch. Today, we consider that to be our first date, and we celebrate our anniversary on that day ‚Äî September 18, 2008.

        |  Yep! Throw in a few more years of high school, 2 ¬Ω years of long distance during college, a couple years together in Ohio, a few years in San Francisco, and that basically brings us up to today! We just moved to Seattle in May, and we‚Äôve got some longer term travel intentions as well.

        |  Our next plan is start travelling internationally, working remotely and hopping from country-to-country for several months at a time. Sarah and I are always looking for the next adventure, experience, or experiment, especially when it comes to food and travel. Marriage will certainly be an adventure in itself!

      dl.faq
        dt.heading Are you registered anywhere?
        dd Gifts are certainly not necessary &mdash; just your presence as we celebrate is enough for us! Though there‚Äôs no need for gifts, we can appreciate that gifting is a primary love language for many of the people we care about. We‚Äôve come up with some options for those folks:
          ul
            li contribute to the <a href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/donate/">Center for Effective Altruism</a> in our honor
            li our <a href="https://www.blueprintregistry.com/registry/sarah-and-michail">travel fund/registry</a>
        dd If you‚Äôre going to simply trust your instincts on this one, we ask that you consider our upcoming travel adventures, as we‚Äôll be putting most of our existing possessions in storage.
        dt.heading Can I bring a date?
        dd Your invite will specify whether there's a plus one for you! If you're unsure, please let us know!
        dt.heading Are kids welcome?
        dd Absolutely! If your invite was addressed to "The Whoever Family," then your kids are 100% welcome to join us.
        dt.heading Where should I park?
        dd For the ceremony, there will be parking inside the park.
        dd For the reception, there's a parking structure diagonally across from The Box which will be the most convenient place to park. We got a deal on a reduced cost for the structure, so let the attendant know you're here for an event at The Box!
        dt.heading What should I wear?
        dd Clothes! Casual, dressy casual, semi-formal &mdash; it's all the same to us! Maybe don't wear a tuxedo, or you might be uncomfortable. We also ask that you leave your white suits and dresses at home for this one.
        dt.heading Whom should I call with questions?
        dd Contact Sarah (262-227-7987) or Michail (414-574-1755) with any questions that might come up.
        dt.heading I am coming from out of town. Where should I stay?
        dd Wherever you want! We‚Äôre not reserving any rooms any place, but we‚Äôre happy to help you find someplace to stay! We‚Äôve got family and friends in the area that are happy to host our guests, otherwise we‚Äôd recommend AirBnB or one of the hotels in the Milwaukee area.
