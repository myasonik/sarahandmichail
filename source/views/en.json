By 7th grade, I‚Äôm pretty sure he had a massive crush on me, so it was unsurprising when in 8th grade, he asked me on a date to ‚Äúeat Oreos and see the new Evan Almighty movie‚Äù with him.",
  "index.about.desc20": "Unfortunately for me, Sarah shot me down! Really, though, how could anyone refuse an offer like that? Realizing I came on a bit strong, I eased up for a couple years. Sarah and I didn‚Äôt become close again until the summer before our sophomore year of high school.",
  "index.about.desc30": "Michail certainly grew up quite a bit between 8th grade and sophomore year, and I couldn‚Äôt help but notice he was becoming quite the young man - funny, clever, and full of boundless energy. However, some things about a person just don‚Äôt change. One day after school, I wasn‚Äôt particularly surprised when Michail told me he‚Äôd lost his house keys, and his parents wouldn‚Äôt be home several hours.",
  "index.about.desc40": "And of course, I couldn‚Äôt stay all alone at school.",
  "index.about.desc50": "Ok, whatever. Either way, Michail rode the bus home with me (with my Mom‚Äôs approval of course ‚Äî thanks, Mom!).",
  "index.about.desc60": "We were already super adorable at that point, so we watched the Lion King and ate a frozen pizza while holding hands on Sarah‚Äôs couch. Today, we consider that to be our first date, and we celebrate our anniversary on that day ‚Äî September 18, 2008.",
  "index.about.desc70": "Yep! Throw in a few more years of high school, 2 ¬Ω years of long distance during college, a couple years together in Ohio, a few years in San Francisco, and that basically brings us up to today! We just moved to Seattle in May, and we‚Äôve got some longer term travel intentions as well.",
  "index.about.desc80": "Our next plan is start travelling internationally, working remotely and hopping from country-to-country for several months at a time. Sarah and I are always looking for the next adventure, experience, or experiment, especially when it comes to food and travel. Marriage will certainly be an adventure in itself!",
